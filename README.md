Airline Passenger Forecasting with LSTM
This project uses a PyTorch LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict the number of airline passengers based on historical monthly data (AirPassengers.csv).
It includes:

Feature engineering (seasonality encoding using sin/cos transformations),

Scaling,

Sequence modeling,

Training,

Forecasting the next 12 months,

And visualizations.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
air_passenger_forecast_lstm.py â€” Main Python script containing:

Data preprocessing

Model building (LSTM)

Model training

Evaluation & Visualization

Future forecasting

AirPassengers.csv â€” Dataset containing monthly passenger counts (1950â€“1960).

ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/air-passenger-forecast.git
cd air-passenger-forecast
Install required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python air_passenger_forecast_lstm.py
The script will train the model, visualize the actual vs predicted values, and forecast passenger numbers for the next 12 months.

ðŸ“Š Output Example
Plot comparing actual and predicted passengers.

Forecast plot for next 12 months (in red dashed line).

ðŸ“š Techniques Used
Time Series Forecasting

Sequence Modeling with LSTM

Feature Engineering (seasonality using sine and cosine)

Min-Max Scaling

PyTorch Deep Learning

Matplotlib Visualization

âœ¨ Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy

Adding more features (holidays, events)

Implement early stopping during training

Exporting model for deployment
